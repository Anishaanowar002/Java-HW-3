# Java-HW-3

From this Vehicle Management System we implemented Create superclass Engine and subclasses CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine and HybridEngine.
Create class Manufacture, with all setters and getters.
Create superclass Vehicle with abstract method ShowCharacteristics(). Create three subclasses ICEV, BEV, HybridV.
Each subclass of class Vehicle should have attribute of class Manufacture and Engine.
Create arraysof Vechiclewhich contains objects of ICEV, BEV, HybridV. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism, to model different types of vehicles with various engines and manufacturers.
in the result we demonstrate characteristics of each vehicle.
The programming language is java and the devloping environment is sublime text 3.
